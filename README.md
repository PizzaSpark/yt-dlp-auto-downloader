## Why do I need to install Python?
The code uses yt-dlp as the video/audio downloader and yt-dlp uses Python.

## Why NanaZip instead of 7Zip?
It's because NanaZip integrates better in Windows 11 context menu. NanaZip also automatically integrates the 7z command in the environment variables which the program needs making our lives easier.

## Is NanaZip safe?
Yes! NanaZip is a fork of 7Zip meaning behind the scenes, it's just the 7Zip source code but a better version of it.

## Now just run the `run.bat` and ENJOY!
